# What is this?

This is a webpage that helps you finding cool domain names which end in some TLD.

For example `christm.as` is one such domain.

This project uses the lovely [simple CSS](https://simplecss.org/).

It's available on [my website](https://dxdt.ch/domains) (whose domain name, unfortunately, is not a clever word which ends in its TLD.)
