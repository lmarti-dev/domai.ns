# What is this?

This is a webpage that helps you finding cool domain names which end in some TLD.

For example `christm.as` is one such domain.

This project uses the lovely [simple CSS](https://simplecss.org/).

It'll soon be available on my website (whose domain name, unfortunately, is not a clever word which ends in its TLD.)
